### Web Application Description

This web application, named "CyberMusix," is designed to provide users with a platform to manage and listen to their music collections online. Users can upload their music files to the platform, create playlists, and listen to their favorite songs from any device with internet access.

### Features

1. **Music Management**: Users can upload their music files to the platform and organize them into playlists.
2. **Playlist Creation**: Users can create custom playlists and add songs to them.
3. **Music Playback**: The application allows users to play their uploaded music directly from the platform.
4. **User Authentication**: Users need to register an account and log in to access the full features of the application.
5. **Security**: The application employs security measures such as password hashing, session management, and encryption to protect user data.

### Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The web application is built using ASP.NET Core framework for server-side development.
- **SQLite**: SQLite is used as the database management system for storing user accounts, music metadata, and playlists.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end development is done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the user interface and implementing interactive features.
- **Razor Pages**: Razor Pages are used for server-side page rendering and generating dynamic content.

### Security Measures

1. **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using a strong cryptographic hash function before storing them in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain secure.
2. **Session Management**: Sessions are managed securely using session tokens. Users are assigned a unique session token upon login, which is stored in a secure cookie. This token is used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests.
3. **Encryption**: Sensitive data such as user credentials and session tokens are encrypted during transmission over the network using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
4. **Authorization**: Certain features of the application, such as accessing playlists or uploading music, are restricted to authenticated users only. Authorization checks are performed to ensure that only authorized users can access these features.
